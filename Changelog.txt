- Followed a tutorial for Rock Textures (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IclsRMai7LY&feature=emb_logo) and made a volcanic rock texture.
- Created a mossy rock that can be edited on how mossy it could be (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwVDlS8uiYg&t=4s), currently using UE4 default assets. The asset is called M_DefaultCoveredRock.
